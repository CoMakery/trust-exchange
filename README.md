Trust Exchange is:
  - An open protocol
  - A toolkit for building and reading distributed trust graphs
  - An ambitious plan to create interoperability between existing and future trust networks
  - Compatible with existing rating schemes (scores, percentages, star ratings, etc)
  - Open Source (MIT licensed)

> We realized that Trust was the currency of the future. Our Trust is the most powerful currency we have, and it is innate to our being. When Trust grows, relationships and exchanges become more fluid and common, from social interactions to economic flow. Most importantly, when we make the landscape of Trust visible, we can see where we are isolated in islands of belief and also where false sources of information originate.”

## Code

> Trust Exchange is a very young codebase, so expect limited functionality, and don't use it in production just yet.

Trust Exchange codebases:

- [JS core library](https://github.com/trust-exchange/js-trust-exchange-core)
- [JS frontend react demo](https://github.com/trust-exchange/trust-exchange-demo-basic)
- [Node JS server](https://github.com/trust-exchange/trust-exchange-server)
- [Node JS CLI](https://github.com/trust-exchange/js-trust-exchange-cli)
- [JSON-LD Schemas](https://github.com/trust-exchange/trust-exchange-schema)
- [Holochain integration](https://github.com/trust-exchange/trust-exchange-holochain)

## Project History

The original vision for Trust Exchange was landed and anchored in 2006 by
[Harlan T Wood](https://github.com/harlantwood),
[Adam Apollo](http://www.adamapollo.com/),
and [Jack Senechal](https://github.com/jacksenechal),
and subsequently published on the
Enlightened Structure
site.

Harlan met [Noah Thorp](https://twitter.com/noahthorp) in 2007,
and their first conversation revolved around this kind
of decentralized trust technology.
In the summer of 2015, Noah, Harlan and [Joel Dietz](http://fractastical.com/)
created an open source, permissively licensed,
reference implementation of Trust Exchange, as a foundation for free, open,
interoperable trust systems.

In 2016, Noah and Harlan worked with
[Christopher Allen](http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/) and
[Manu Sporny](http://manu.sporny.org/) to bring
Bitcoin encryption to JSON-LD signed claims.  This work led to a
Portable Reputation Toolkit
[whitepaper](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-fall2016/blob/master/final-documents/reputation-toolkit.pdf) and
[technical implementation](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/portable-reputation-toolkit),
the latter of which was then folded back into a reboot of this codebase
in early 2017, notably centered around JSON-LD signed claims.
